# IPT Reactor Demo: JUG Wishes 1.0
End-to-end reactive WebSockets demo with Angular 2 (TypeScript) and RxJS (RxNext) and JavaSE + Project Reactor at server side. No web server needed - all resources as well as live WebSocket events are served by custom HTTP endpoint using Reactor Net.

Limitaion: Demo working well in Chrome, but not in Firefox, because of WebSocket implementation coming from Reactor Net. Further investigation needed.
